The source code in this assignment can be compiled from the command line in the Terminal.

To compile the program, locate the directory where the files are in and enter: javac MainHuffTree.java HuffmanDecoder.java HuffmanEncoder.java HuffmanTree.java Node.java PreOrderTraversalGenerator.java PriorityQueue.java

To run the program, locate the directory where the complied files are in and enter: java MainHuffTree

You will be promoted for two input files. You may use whatever files you wish, but the two that will be with the project will be called frequencytable.txt and strings.txt for the frequency table and strings to encode/decode respectively. The program will prompt you for the frequencytable.txt file first and the strings.txt second.

You will then be promoted for an output file. Again you may use whatever file you wish. Once you enter the name of the file you wish to create, a new file will appear in the directory containing the order, the matrix itself, and the determinant of matrix or matrices in the input file.
